    The GOAT

Hello World
  <p>
Any person who uses logic, reason, and facts should realize and face the fact that LeBron James is the greatest basketball
    player of all time. In every statistical category he surpasses MJ, except for PPG. But between rebounds, assists, blocks, steals,
    triple doubles, he has more in every category. His FG% and 3PT% is more efficient than Michael Jordan. He has been to the finals 9
    times, meaning he consistently makes it deep into the playoffs, with much worse teams I might add. Every time LeBron leaves a team,
    they are destined for the lottery. But whenever MJ retired the first time, the Bulls still won over 50 games the next season with
    Scottie Pippen as their best player. And if you look at the advanced statistics, almost all of the teams LeBron has faced in the 
    finals are better statistically that the teams that MJ and the Bulls faced. I will admit, it is true that LeBron had a seismic
    -level choke in the 2011 finals. But at the same time, people drastically underestimate those Mavericks that also beat a pre-
    achilles tear Kobe Bryant, and a young future MVP trio in Oklahoma City. But ever since that finals loss against Dallas, LeBron 
    has consistently shown up every year in the playoffs and destroyed, especially in elimination games.
